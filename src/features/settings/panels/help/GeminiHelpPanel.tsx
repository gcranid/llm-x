Note: assuming setup was done properly Gemini Nano should connect automatically on your machine!

### How to connect to [Gemini nano (built into chrome)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/client-side) :

Gemini nano is currently in preview mode and can only be accessed on chrome canary versions with the correct permissions turned on
To turn this on you'll need to follow the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VG8HIyz361zGduWgNG7R_R8Xkv0OOJ8b5C9QKeCjU0c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.witohboigk0o)

This setup is mostly beta on Google's side and LLMX's side as well. IF you experience any issues please add report it to LLMX's [github issues section](https://github.com/mrdjohnson/llm-x/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
